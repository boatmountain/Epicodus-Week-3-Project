# Epicodus Week 3 Project 

#### JavascriptLoops and Arrays, April 3, 2020

#### By Dominic Montelongo

## Description

This program will demonstrate use of loops and arrays with Javascript.

According to the text:

"Mr. Roboger's Neighborhood
Create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:

Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in your finished program,

The number 13 should be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
The number 21 should be replaced with "Boop".
The number 32 should be replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again."

Additional objectives

"If you finish meeting the objectives for this project, consider adding additional features, such as:

Add images, styling, and custom animations.
Implement different behaviors/effects/images for different inputs.
Include an option that returns the output in reversed order (beginning with the largest number).
Add a second form field that takes a name. For numbers that are divisible by 3, add the users name to the output e.g. "Won't you be my neighbor, Dana?"
